## Problem statement
Gamers often have to switch between different windows and applications to chat with friends, read gaming news, and launch their favorite games. This can be disruptive and time-consuming, and it can also lead to performance issues.

## Our solution
GameHub is a browser extension that provides a one-stop shop for gamers to chat, read gaming news, launch their favorite games, and monitor their CPU usage. This eliminates the need for gamers to switch between different windows and applications, and it can also help to improve performance by reducing the number of applications that are running simultaneously.

## Approach to that solution
GameHub uses a variety of technologies to implement its features, including:

- **Web sockets:** For real-time chat communication
- **Scraping:** To automatically collect gaming news articles from popular websites
- **API integration:** To integrate with gaming platforms such as Steam
- **In-game overlay:** To provide users with access to chat and gaming news without having to leave their game
- **Notifications:** To alert users to new messages and news articles
- **Game performance tracking:** To track users' game performanceÂ metrics

## Technology stack used in this project
**Programming languages used**
- **HTML 5, CSS 3 and Javascript:** Chrome extensions are essentially  web pages. HTML for the structure,
CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the  functionality of the extension.
- **Chrome Extension APIs:** Utilize Chrome Extension APIs to  enable seamless integration and interaction within the browser environment.
- **Background Scripts:** This extensions will be having the  background scripts, that run in the background, even when the extension's popup or content scripts are not active
- **Manifest File:** The manifest.json file is a crucial component. It will contain the  metadata about extension,  including its name, version,  permissions, and how it will interacts with gamers and developers.

**Version Control**
- **Git and Github**: A version control system and platform that helps you manage your codebase, collaborate with others, and track changes.

**IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**
- **Visual Studio Code**: It is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is widely used by software developers and programmers to write, edit, and debug code for various programming languages.
